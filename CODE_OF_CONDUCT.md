## Expected behavior

This section lists the behaviors we want to see in issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews. These expectations are intentionally simple and practical. When in doubt, choose the option that reduces friction and increases clarity.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it privately to the maintainers.


- **Preferred:** GitHub Security Advisories (private report).
- **Alternative:** Email the maintainer address listed in the repository profile.

Include:

- **What happened:** Links, screenshots, and timestamps.
- **Who was involved:** Usernames or profiles.
- **Context:** Any extra context that helps us understand the situation.

## Enforcement

This section describes what maintainers may do in response to unacceptable behavior. Actions are taken to protect the community and keep project spaces usable. The exact response will depend on severity and context.

Maintainers may remove content, block accounts, or take other actions they deem appropriate to keep the community safe.

## Scope

This section clarifies where this Code of Conduct applies. In general, it covers project spaces and contexts where someone is representing the project. If you are unsure whether a situation is in scope, report it and let maintainers decide.

This Code of Conduct applies in project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, code reviews) and when representing the project in public.
